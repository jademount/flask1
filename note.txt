1.run test.py to create database file and insert user infos into the sqlite3 db
2.run app.py to start the flask web server
3.testing the web server in postman, before posting and getting new items,
submit the authentication info (username and password)
4.flowing chart:

  post an item with name and price(data=Item.parser.parse_args()) in postman
  -> item added to list of items
  -> using get verb to get the item
  -> because of @jwt_required decorator before def get(), the server requires authentication
  -> jwt looks into security.py for authenticate and identity method
  -> authenticate method uses the find_by_username method in User class to see if the user is
     in the database and check if the pass provided in the http post is the same as in the
     database.
  -> not sure what identity method in security.py does with the keyword "payload"
